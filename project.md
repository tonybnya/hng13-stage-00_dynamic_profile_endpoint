# Stage 0 Task: Build a Dynamic Profile Endpoint

Welcome to Stage 0! :dart:
In this task, you'll build a simple RESTful API endpoint that returns your profile information along with a dynamic cat fact fetched from an external API. This task validates your ability to consume third-party APIs, format JSON responses, and return dynamic data.

## Task — Profile Endpoint (core requirements)

*Required endpoint*

- Create a GET endpoint at: `/me`
- The endpoint must return JSON data with Content-Type: `application/json`
- Must integrate with the Cat Facts API to fetch dynamic cat facts

*Response structure (required fields)*
Your endpoint must return a JSON response in this exact format:
```json
```
```json

```
```
```
```
```json
```
{
  "status": "success",
  "user": {
    "email": "<your email>",
    "name": "<your full name>",
    "stack": "<your backend stack>"
  },
  "timestamp": "<current UTC time in ISO 8601 format>",
  "fact": "<random cat fact from Cat Facts API>"
}
```
```
```
```

*Field specifications*

- *status* — Must always be the string "success"
- *user.email* — Your personal email address
- *user.name* — Your full name
- *user.stack* — Your backend technology stack (e.g., "Node.js/Express", "Python/Django", "Go/Gin")
- *timestamp* — Current UTC time in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-10-15T12:34:56.789Z")
- *fact* — A random cat fact fetched from the Cat Facts API

## Implementation guidance

*Dynamic timestamp*

- The timestamp must reflect the current UTC time at the moment of the request
- Use ISO 8601 format for consistency
- The timestamp should update with every new request

*Cat Facts API integration*

- Endpoint to use: [https://catfact.ninja/fact](https://catfact.ninja/fact)
- Fetch a new cat fact on every request to /me
- Handle potential API failures gracefully (consider what happens if the external API is down)
- Set appropriate timeout values for the external API call

*Error handling*

- If the Cat Facts API fails, consider returning a fallback message or an error response
- Handle network errors and timeouts appropriately
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes

*Best practices*

- Use environment variables for configuration where appropriate
- Include proper CORS headers if needed
- Add basic logging for debugging
- Consider rate limiting if deploying publicly

*Acceptance criteria (checklist for grading / automated tests)*

- A working `GET /me` endpoint is accessible and returns a 200 OK status
- Response structure strictly follows the defined JSON schema
- All required fields (`status` , `user`, `timestamp`, `fact`) are present
- `user` object contains `email`, `name`, and `stack` fields with valid string values
- `timestamp` field returns the current UTC time in ISO 8601 format
- `timestamp` updates dynamically with every new request
- `fact` field contains a cat fact fetched from the Cat Facts API
- A new cat fact is fetched on every request (not cached)
- Response Content-Type header is `application/json`
- Code is well-structured and follows best practices for your chosen stack

*Submission instructions*

- You can implement this in any language of your choice (eg Fortran, C, Assembly etc)
- *Host the API:* Vercel is forbidden this cohort, and no Render, other options like (Railway, Heroku, AWS, PXXL App etc.) are accepted.
- Include the GitHub repo link with:
    Clear README with setup instructions
    Instructions to run locally
    List of dependencies and how to install them
    Environment variables needed (if any)
- *Test your endpoint* before submission — ensure it returns the correct response format
- Provide any relevant tests, API documentation, or notes in the repo
- You’re to create a rich LinkedIn, Dev(.)to, Hashnode, Medium, or X (formerly Twitter) post on the task above detailing your work processes, what this task taught you, and supporting snapshots/images/videos of your work (*`important`*)
